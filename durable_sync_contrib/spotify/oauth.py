"""Spotify binding of the generic OAuth client (durable_sync.auth.oauth.flow).

Unlike Notion/Contentful, Spotify offers NO Dynamic Client Registration and NO
discovery document: you register an app once in the Spotify developer dashboard
(https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) to get a fixed `client_id`, and the
endpoints are well-known constants. So this binding PINS the endpoints + the
read scope and re-exports only the PKCE pieces the bootstrap needs — there is no
`discover()`/`register_client()` here on purpose.

Spotify supports Authorization Code + PKCE for public clients (no client secret),
and ROTATES the refresh token on every refresh — both already handled by the
generic flow + OAuthTokenWorkflow.
